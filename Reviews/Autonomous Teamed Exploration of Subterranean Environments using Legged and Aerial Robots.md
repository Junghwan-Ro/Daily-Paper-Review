## Paper summary (What)
- The paper proposes a system for autonomous exploration of subterranean environments using a team of legged and aerial robots.
- The system combines the advantages of both robot types to increase efficiency and reliability.
- The authors present a planning framework that allows the robots to cooperate and efficiently explore the environment.

## Issues addressed by the paper (Why)
- Subterranean environments pose challenges to robotic exploration, such as rough terrain and limited line-of-sight.
- The paper aims to address these challenges by combining the strengths of legged and aerial robots in a cooperative exploration framework.

## Detailed Information (How)

### Methodology
- The authors propose a multi-robot system consisting of legged and aerial robots.
- The planning framework includes a hierarchical structure with high-level mission allocation and low-level motion planning for each robot type.

### Results
- The authors demonstrate the feasibility of their system in simulation and real-world experiments.
- The results show that the proposed system can successfully explore subterranean environments with increased efficiency and reliability.

### Limitations
- The paper does not discuss the limitations related to communication between the robots in subterranean environments.
- The experiments were conducted in controlled environments, which might not fully represent real-world subterranean conditions.

## Conclusions

### The author's conclusions
- The authors conclude that their proposed system, which combines legged and aerial robots for autonomous exploration of subterranean environments, is feasible and effective.

## Possible future work / improvements
- Test the system in more diverse and complex real-world subterranean environments.
